# Gantt-chart
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. This chart lists the tasks to
be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the
horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity. Gantt charts illustrate the start and
finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and
summary elements constitute the work breakdown structure of the project
